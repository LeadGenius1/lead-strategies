# CURSOR DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW - MANDATORY FOR EVERY CODE CHANGE

For EVERY code change, follow this workflow WITHOUT asking permission.

## STEP 1: CODE CHANGE
- Make the requested change
- Test locally if applicable
- Show what was changed

## STEP 2: GIT COMMIT & PUSH (AUTOMATIC)
```
cd C:\Users\ailea\OneDrive\Documents\lead-strategies-repo
git add .
git status
git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
git push origin main
```
- Never ask "should I push?" - ALWAYS push
- If push fails, STOP and report error

## STEP 3: RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION
Wait 60 seconds after push, then:
- Backend: `https://api.aileadstrategies.com/health` -> expect 200 OK, {"status":"ok"}
- Frontend: `curl -I https://aileadstrategies.com` -> expect 200 OK

## STEP 4: RAILWAY LOGS (if health fails)
```
railway logs --service backend
railway logs --service frontend
```
Show last 50 lines, identify error.

## STEP 5: FIX ERRORS
- Identify exact error from logs
- Fix the issue
- Return to STEP 2 (commit, push, verify)
- Repeat until healthy

## STEP 6: FINAL CONFIRMATION (REQUIRED)
Only after ALL checks pass:
```
DEPLOYMENT VERIFIED 100%
- Git push: SUCCESS
- Railway backend: HEALTHY
- Railway frontend: HEALTHY
- Ready for production
```

## RULES
1. NEVER ask permission to push - just do it
2. NEVER skip Railway verification
3. NEVER stop at errors - fix and re-verify
4. NEVER say "complete" without 100% confirmation
5. If verification fails 3 times, STOP and ask for help
