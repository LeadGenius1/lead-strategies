# Mandatory: Push All Changes to GitHub

**RULE:** After making ANY code changes, you MUST commit and push to GitHub.

## Why
- Deployments (Railway, Vercel, etc.) pull from GitHub
- Unpushed changes never reach production
- The user will not see fixes or new features until they are pushed

## Workflow
1. After completing edits: `git add` the changed files
2. `git commit -m "descriptive message"`
3. `git push`

## Do NOT
- Leave changes uncommitted
- Assume the user will push manually
- Skip pushing "small" changes

## Apply
Every session that modifies code must end with a successful `git push` to the remote repository.
