CRITICAL RESTORATION TASK - READ CAREFULLY

GOAL: Restore the AI Lead Strategies platform to the EXACT state it was in BEFORE any Google OAuth work, WITH all TackleAI references removed.

WHAT WE NEED TO RESTORE:
1. The AETHER UI design system (dark theme, purple accents, animated grids)
2. The complete hero section with:
   - "ONE PLATFORM INFINITE REVENUE" headline
   - "7 Agents Active" status indicator
   - Animated counter stats
   - Professional AETHER styling

3. Complete feature content including:
   - "22+ channels" unified inbox messaging
   - "7 AI agents" references and descriptions
   - All VideoSite.IO features and upgrades
   - All LeadSite.AI features
   - All LeadSite.IO features (website builder)
   - All ClientContact.IO features (unified inbox)
   - n8n workflow integrations descriptions
   - All enterprise-grade features

4. Platform navigation showing: AI LEAD, LEADSITE.AI, LEADSITE.IO, CLIENTCONTACT, VIDEOSITE
   (NOTE: Remove any TACKLE.IO references)

5. Pricing tiers (WITHOUT Tackle):
   - LeadSite.AI: $49/mo (1,000 leads/month)
   - LeadSite.IO: $49/mo (1,000 leads + 1 free website)
   - ClientContact.IO: $149/mo (22+ channel inbox)
   - VideoSite.IO: (Add pricing if available)

6. All dashboard features, analytics, campaigns functionality
7. All the upgraded content from the "initial commit" or latest feature-complete version

WHAT TO REMOVE:
- ALL TackleAI/Tackle.IO branding
- Tackle.IO navigation links
- Tackle.IO pricing tier ($249)
- Any Tackle CRM references

FILES TO CHECK AND RESTORE:
- app/page.tsx (main landing page - CRITICAL)
- app/signup/page.tsx (remove Tackle tier)
- app/clientcontact-io/page.tsx
- app/leadsite-ai/page.tsx
- app/leadsite-io/page.tsx
- app/videosite-io/page.tsx
- app/dashboard/*.tsx (all dashboard pages)
- components/* (all UI components)

CURRENT PROBLEM:
The site is showing a simple purple HTML page instead of the full Next.js React application with all features.

REFERENCE COMMITS:
Look at commit 151f836 (Initial commit) and commit 98be471 (pricing updates) for the complete feature set.

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Review the current state of all files
2. Restore ALL missing content and features
3. Ensure AETHER design is fully implemented
4. Remove ALL TackleAI references
5. Verify all 22+ channels and 7 agents content is present
6. Test that the site serves the React app, not static HTML

DEPLOYMENT NOTE:
- This Next.js app lives at: C:\Users\ailea\Documents\lead-strategies
- Railway "strong-communication" must deploy THIS repo (lead-strategies) for aileadstrategies.com to serve the React app.
- If Railway is currently deploying aileadstrategies-frontend (static HTML), switch the deploy source to the lead-strategies repo so customers see the full React app.

This is a PRODUCTION EMERGENCY. The current deployment is showing the wrong content to customers.
